# actf_temp
The purpose of this repository is for the team to add comments to and run https://github.com/ialara/actf/blob/lotsa-runs/baseline_status_quo_10x8_tos30_inxtails33.ipynb for understanding before it is transfered to and worked in a different repository without interfering with the original repository.

To distinguish between comments made by the creator and the commentor, add your initials to the front of a comment. e.g. #rtb [this is my comment]
